# better-tmi.js
A better version of tmi.js with planned Discord integration and more!

---

tmi.js is Twitch's official library for JavaScript interaction with their API. There's only one problem: It hasn't been updated in almost 2 years.

That's why I am making a better version with more functionality, and capabilities!
